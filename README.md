## Computational Neuroscience Basics

This site summarizes numerous small projects which illustrate basic concepts in computational neuroscience. The projects start from the basic Integrate and Fire Model used to model neurons and build up to the Perceptron for binary classification and Temporal Difference Learning to illustrate classical conditioning. 


### [Integrate and Fire Model](https://github.com/Ilsa07/Integrate-and-Fire-Model)
This project illustrates the simplified Integrate and Fire neuron model, which describes neurons as RC circuits. In this model incoming current increases the voltage of the neuron, and if the current is big enough and maintained for long enough, the neuron will reach its threshold voltage and will spike. After a spike, the volatage of the neuron is resetted to its resting voltage. This model does not contain adoption, which means that after a spike it is "as fresh as a daisy", it is not harder for it to spike again.
